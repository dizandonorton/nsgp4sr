% this function calculates the novelty score
function score = B(ind, gen, pop_size, gen_anterior, data)
	% calculates the raw fitness of the individual on each fitness case
	if gen = 0
		% returns the raw fitness
	else
		% calculates the average distance of the individual's raw fitness and the individuals on the previous generation
		% returns the distance
end





for each generation
	for each individual
		if generation = 0
			calculates the raw fitness of each individual on each fitness case
			% the novel individual is the one with higher fitness
			% novelty score is the fitness
			% distance between fitnesses, phenotypes
		else
			calculates the average distance (euclidean) of the current individual's raw fitness and the individuals on 
			the previous generation's fitness (maximization)
			% the novel individual is the one with higher fitness
		end

	% store the novel individuals
