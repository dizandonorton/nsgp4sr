nsgp4sr
=======

Novelty Search, as defined in (Lehman & Stanley, 2008), is a technique used in Evolutionary Robotics to substitute the fitness
function with a novelty measure in order to explore the behavioral space of the individuals (solutions) during generations. 
Novelty Search is having recognized success in many experiments involving Evolutionary Robotics, Neuro-Evolution and other 
Evolutionary Computation subfields.

nsgp4sr is an algorithm that implements the novelty search approach for symbolic regression problems in Genetic Programming.
This is the second try at the problem of applying novelty search for symbolic regression, being the first one presented in
(Martinez et al., 2013).
